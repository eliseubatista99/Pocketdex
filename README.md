# Pocketdex

This project was developed during my Android training. The main objective was to develop a mobile application that meets the following requirements:

- Making calls to an API (PokeApi was chosen) using Retrofit
- Have a RecyclerView with a paging system
- Have an offline caching system, where the Api data is stored in cache, and updated only once a day (when the app is closed and the phone is using Wi-Fi)
- Use the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller)

# How to install

1) Download the PocketDex.apk and install it on your phone
  -- OR --
2) Clone the project and run it on Android Studio or other IDE
